note right of UC1
  Monitors system calls from
  the robot in real-time with
  11,200+ calls/second throughput
end note

note right of UC7
  Uses LSTM encoder-decoder
  model to identify patterns in
  system call sequences
end note

note right of UC10
  Detects anomalies using
  trained patterns and
  configurable thresholds
end note

note right of UC30
  Validates sensor data integrity
  before it reaches main control
  board. Checks for tampering
  and falsified data.
end note

note right of UC32
  Emergency stop capability
  triggered when data tampering
  is detected. Prevents robot
  from making any movements.
end note

note bottom of UC26
  Collects data from UMD Husky
  robot components:
  - global_planner (56.6%)
  - front_ouster (25.7%)
  - os_cloud_node (11.2%)
  - Other components (6.5%)
end note

note right of UC19
  Supports multiple export
  formats for 1.4GB+ datasets
  with 1.2M+ system calls
end note
